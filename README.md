# AboutJava


## There are two types of web pages - 
1. Static webpages
2. Dynamic webpages

- Static webpages mean when we click on a button or link, there is no response.It is filled with HTML,CSS and Javascript code.

- Dynamic webpages means when we click on a button or link, there is going to be a response. Java will make the server dynamic.


## Layers

There are three layers:

 1 - Client Layer
 
2 - Server Layer

3 - Database Layer

You can call the client layer the presentation layer. The client layer is full of HTML,CSS and Javascript code. It will make a request to the server layer.

The server layer will receive the request. The server layer is full of Java code. It will check the request that the Client layer sent. If the request, the client layer sent is correct, it will store into the data base. The server layer will give a response to the CLient layer and the client layer will display the data into UI.


## About Java

Java is a popular programming language.It is object oriented. That means that Java deals with classes. Inside the class, we cannot write the code directly. We have to write the method. Inside a class you can write as many methods as you can.



James Gosling invented it in 1995. It went public in 1996. The original company was "Sun micro systems", but Oracle purchased it in 2010. The name java comes from an oak tree. The java logo is a cup of coffee or tea with steam rising.

The trial version was in 1995. 

Initial version - 1996 - 1.0

Current version is Java 20, released in March, 21st 2023.
