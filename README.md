- Static webpages mean when we click on a button or link, there is no response.It is filled with HTML,CSS and Javascript code.

- Dynamic webpages means when we click on a button or link, there is going to be a response. Java will make the server dynamic.


## Layers

There are three layers:

 1 - Client Layer
 
2 - Server Layer

3 - Database Layer

You can call the client layer the presentation layer. The client layer is full of HTML,CSS and Javascript code. It will make a request to the server layer.

The server layer will receive the request. The server layer is full of Java code. It will check the request that the Client layer sent. If the request, the client layer sent is correct, it will store into the data base. The server layer will give a response to the CLient layer and the client layer will display the data into UI.
